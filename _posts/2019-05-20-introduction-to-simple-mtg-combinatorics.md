title:  An introduction to the math of Magic the Gathering card draw
---

Magic the Gathering is a card game, and card games always involve probabilities. Anyone who's taken a course in probability or
combinatorics know card games and dice are a favourite among text book authors. 

Magic has a rich set of mechanics, but it all revolves around drawing cards. When building a deck you'll have to be mindful of
this, and plan your deck accordingly. Often some simple but really intuitive math can help guide your decisions.

## Who's this for?
Obviously you like Magic, or have an interest. Maybe you want to answer some of the common questions you have when you are building a Magic deck without entering it into a computer.
Or maybe you are just curious how they work.

This introduction will not assume great knowledge about maths, but hopefully you can add, multiply and divide. A basic grasp of algebra is helpful too.

I will not provide proofs for anything, because I don't think it will help the target audience much.

Most of the examples will deal with 40 card, limited decks, because that is what I'm most familiar with. But if you are more interested
in 60 card decks, you can usually just substitute 40 for 60.

## About this guide
I am relatively new to Magic, and I'm no Euler, so it might contain both errors in regards to MtG and in regards to the maths involved.

If you spot an error please do get in touch and tell me.

## 1. The building blocks

### 1.1. How many ways can we draw 40 cards?

#### How many different ways can we sort a deck?

#### A caveat

### 1.2. How many different ways can we draw 7 cards from a 40 card deck?

## 2. Probabilities

### 2.1. The basics

### 2.2. Whats the probability we get one of our 1-drops in the first hand?
